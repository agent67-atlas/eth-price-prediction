## 🔬 Data Science Methodology

Our prediction system is built on rigorous data science principles. See [METHODOLOGY.md](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) for comprehensive details on:

### Core Principles

1. **Data Quality First**: Real-time data from liquid markets (Binance), validated for completeness and accuracy
2. **Feature Engineering**: 15+ technical indicators derived from OHLCV data
3. **Model Diversity**: Multiple algorithms capture different market patterns
4. **Ensemble Learning**: Weighted combination based on validated performance
5. **Continuous Validation**: Rolling window backtesting and walk-forward analysis
6. **Risk Awareness**: Confidence intervals and prediction uncertainty quantification

### Model Validation Metrics

We track multiple metrics to ensure model reliability:

- **R² Score**: Proportion of variance explained (target: >0.70)
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error in dollars (target: <$5)
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error in dollars (target: <$3)
- **Directional Accuracy**: % of correct up/down predictions (target: >60%)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns from predictions (target: >1.0)

### Self-Correction Mechanisms

1. **Adaptive Weighting**: Model weights adjust based on recent performance
2. **Outlier Detection**: Anomalous predictions are flagged and filtered
3. **Regime Detection**: System adapts to different market conditions (trending, ranging, volatile)
4. **Continuous Retraining**: Models update with new data every prediction cycle
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of prediction accuracy vs. actual prices

See [MODEL_VALIDATION.md](docs/MODEL_VALIDATION.md) for detailed validation procedures.

## Technical Indicators

The system calculates and uses the following indicators:

| Indicator | Purpose | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **SMA (5, 10, 20, 50)** | Trend identification | Price above SMA = bullish |
| **EMA (5, 10, 20)** | Responsive trend | Faster reaction to price changes |
| **RSI (14)** | Momentum | >70 overbought, <30 oversold |
| **MACD (12, 26, 9)** | Trend strength | Crossovers signal trend changes |
| **Bollinger Bands** | Volatility | Price near bands = potential reversal |
| **Volume Ratio** | Confirmation | High volume confirms price moves |
| **Momentum (10)** | Rate of change | Positive = accelerating upward |

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.py` to customize:

```python
# Data settings
SYMBOL = 'ETHUSDT'          # Trading pair
INTERVAL = '1m'             # Candlestick interval
DATA_POINTS = 500           # Historical data points

# Model settings
ENSEMBLE_WEIGHTS = 'auto'   # 'auto' or custom weights
POLYNOMIAL_DEGREE = 2       # Polynomial regression degree
RF_ESTIMATORS = 100         # Random Forest trees
RF_MAX_DEPTH = 10           # Tree depth

# Prediction settings
FORECAST_PERIODS = [15, 30, 60, 120]  # Minutes ahead
CONFIDENCE_LEVEL = 0.95     # For confidence intervals

# Validation settings
BACKTEST_PERIODS = 100      # Periods to backtest
CV_FOLDS = 5                # Cross-validation folds
```

## Visualization Examples

The system generates three types of charts:

1. **Prediction Overview**: Historical data + multi-model predictions + confidence bands
2. **Technical Indicators**: Four-panel chart with Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages, RSI, MACD
3. **Trend Line Analysis**: Focused 1-hour view with clear trend lines and slopes

All charts are saved as high-resolution PNG files (300 DPI) suitable for reports and presentations.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## Automated Prediction Scheduling

This repository is equipped with a fully automated prediction system that generates and commits reports every 4 hours. This provides a continuous, real-time track record of the model's performance.

### How It Works

- **GitHub Actions**: A pre-configured workflow runs on a schedule (`0 */4 * * *`).
- **Report Generation**: The `src/generate_report.py` script is executed.
- **Commits**: New reports are automatically committed to the `reports/` directory.

### Report Structure

- **Archive**: All historical reports are stored in `reports/YYYY/MM/DD/`.
- **Latest**: The most recent report is always available in `reports/latest/`.

For more details on setup and management, see the [**Automation Documentation**](docs/AUTOMATION.md).
